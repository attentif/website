# What I do

## Software

Originally trained as an IT engineer, I have over 15 years of experience crafting careful code to build apps and tools, networked or standalone, big or small.

## Graphic & UX design

Mostly self-taught. Visual identity, typography, interaction design, information architecture, content strategy. On digital or printed media.

## Coaching & consulting

Respectful practices in software development, project management, collaboration, and startup entrepreneurship.

## Anything true and/or beautiful

This is an invitation.

# How I do it

- Leaving space for **availability**, **quiet time** and **attention**
- Considering each situation as **unique**
- Taking **baby steps** when needed
- Cultivating and encouraging **multidisciplinarity**
- Keeping things **simple**.

# Purpose

## attentif isn't here to make money
That does not mean money shouldn't be paid for what I do, but payment – gifting back – can take many forms. Besides money, it can be something you do for me, or something you do for someone else (pay it forward). Or it can be just the fun of doing something together.

## attentif is here to support projects I like
Whether we're fully co-creating or I'm just giving a little hand, I look for the sense of helping something meaningful.

# Contact me

Workshop activity is paused for now, but I’m glad to discuss any collaboration that might follow.
