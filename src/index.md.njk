# What do we know?

## Here

used to be a rather standard (in form at least) introduction to what I do, how I do it, and the purpose of this particular professional endeavour of mine. Like a lot of things we used to know or thought we knew, it seemed it didn't serve anymore.

## Now

below is another attempt at presenting where I'm at, why you might want to get in touch, discuss your challenges and ideas, and perhaps work with me. Or – just as important – not.

# So far

## Software

Most of my professional work since I was trained as an IT engineer – a long time ago – has been crafting code, and helping others do it. I worked in consulting firms, went freelance, co-founded a start-up, moved across the Earth, was employed again, and overall contributed to a pretty wide variety of projects (for more details: <a href="{{linkURLs.linkedIn}}" class="external">LinkedIn</a>).

## Graphic & UX design

I never formally learned design, but always leaned towards it and managed to incorporate some in many of my contributions. I've done visual identity, typography, interaction design, information architecture, content strategy, on digital and analog media.

## Team collaboration

Doing 'project management' earned me praise but did not fit me. I found 'team collaboration' to be a more honest and fruitful angle, and the primary aspect of my efforts working in teams since I quit consulting. How to learn, reflect and communicate as a group in ways that are effectual and respectful? How to set up efficient tooling and processes while embracing our human messiness? That sort of fluid, living questions.

## Work ethics

Apparently doing the _Right Thing_ has always been a disposition of mine, which both served and distressed others – and myself. I learned that doing right sometimes goes wrong, and that letting things go wrong can be right. I may even have learned that there is no wrong decision. But I remain mindful, within my limitations, of what each one means to people and the rest of Life.

# Next

For what I know, coming next could be to throw all the above aside and go farming. In this time, I doubt most of us really have an idea. I'm currently exploring side tracks (like movement and music), that may remain just that or lead to something else. I'm certainly looking for what I've practiced so far to serve into the future, helping me do my part for our collective healing, for Life, for Beauty – because those are not just ideals. 'How' is not up to me though. It might be up to you.

# Contact me

I am based in Hong Kong for the time being, but I am <!-- TODO: helper for article links --><a href="/a/2020-03-31-back-to-switzerland">planning my return to Switzerland</a> with my family.
