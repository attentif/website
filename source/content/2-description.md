## Art
On the written page, the backlit screen, into the vibrating air or within the space held over earth.

## Software
I craft client, server and peer-to-peer apps and tools. Code that bows into service to joy, beauty and truth.

## User experience
Interaction design, user research, information architecture, content strategy. Make what you're here for seen, heard, felt.

## Coaching & consulting
I have over 10 years of experience with sustainable development.

## Anything true and beautiful
That is an invitation.
