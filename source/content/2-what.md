## Graphic & experience design

Mostly self-taught. Visual identity, typography, interaction design, information architecture, content strategy. On digital or printed media.

## Coaching & consulting

I have years of experience with sustainable practices in development, collaboration and entrepreneurship to share.

## Anything true and/or beautiful

This is an invitation.
