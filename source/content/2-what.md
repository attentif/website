## Software

## Graphic & UX design

Mostly self-taught. Visual identity, typography, interaction design, information architecture, content strategy. On digital or printed media.

## Coaching & consulting

Respectful practices in software development, project management, collaboration, and startup entrepreneurship.

## Anything true and/or beautiful

This is an invitation.
