## Software

Originally trained as an IT engineer, I have over 15 years of experience crafting careful code to build apps and tools, networked or standalone, big or small.

## Graphic & experience design

Mostly self-taught. Visual identity, typography, interaction design, information architecture, content strategy. On screen or printed media.

## Coaching & consulting

I have years of experience with sustainable development practices and entrepreneurship to share.

## Anything true and/or beautiful

This is an invitation.
